Tom Waits - Fish and Bird

This is a project interpreting the lyrics to "Fish and Bird" by Tom Waits by use of HTML and CSS styling with animations to create a webpage.

This project was inspired by my love of this song, and its relation to my ideas surrounding community. When I first heard this song, I interpreted it as a tragic love story centered around loss, longing, and missed chances, but upon further reflection the themes of the song resonate with a sense of community as a whole. 

The themes of the song regarding lost love and missed chance for love also apply very readily to the feeling of a lost community and a missed chance for community. The allegory of the bird and the whale who fall in love but are unable to ever be together, relayed by the sailor who connects the tale to his own lost love, connects strongly to my experiences where I have had to leave my community, be it my friends, family, or lovers, behind.


The project was created through simple HTML text and the use of CSS to implement font, edit colors, create a background, and create animations that reflect the themes of the story. I chose a variety of color palettes that I believed reflected the themes of the song, along with generally soft fade-in animations to reflect the gentle and poignant quality of the lyrics. The colors chosen were to evoke the imagery found in the song, including the warm tones to suggest the wood and fireplace of the bar or tavern setting in the first verse, and the cool blues and purples placed together in a gradient to evoke the imagery of the sea and the night sky.
